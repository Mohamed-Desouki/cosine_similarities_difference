# cosine_similarities_difference
calculate difference between 2 stable diffusion models.
When I am reading about stable diffusion models merges I found on this model (https://github.com/recoilme/losslessmix), and ((https://github.com/hako-mikan/sd-webui-supermerger)))  mentioned "total output blocks similarity: 95.4978% and total input blocks similarity: 87.7581% (MID0 seems too low relatively".
I like the stable diffusion and I am not good at python; it is a hobby; but I tried to go through your code and with losslessmix code to get a script to calculate the cosine similarity.
I made this code:

# Cosine Similarities - Difference
This python script aims to calculate difference between 2 stable diffusion models.
When I am reading about stable diffusion models merges I found on this model (https://github.com/recoilme/losslessmix), and (https://github.com/hako-mikan/sd-webui-supermerger).
I thght about calculating the difference between the models before the merge and save some time to decide if the models are close enough or far to merge. Hence we can use another models.
I made this python script to compare the 2 models and output the results into 2 text files, one for the similarities below 90% and the other for higher or equal to 90 %.
I suggested tje code to (hako-mikan) and he merged the code into his code.
By the way his extension is the best for stable diffusion merges.
